# Projectile trajectory graph
The project is used to plot the flight trajectory of the projectile.

## General info
In the application window, known projectile parameters are entered, such as: velocity, firing angle, initial height, mass 
and diameter. On this basis, the bullet trajectory is calculated and a graph is drawn after clicking the 'Generate 
trajectory' button. The graph shows the trajectory with and without air resistance.

## Technologies
Project was created with:
* numpy version: 1.23.5
* matplotlib version: 3.6.2
